                On this project, I was the engine programmer. This team composed of 4 other programmers and 2 designers. For this team, I decided that a component-based architecture engine would be best for the team, as the programmers on the team expressed lack of familiarity with C++ concepts. On this team, I implemented systems such as Serialization, Physics, Particle effects, Debugging tools, Unit Tests, and etc. On this team, I spent a lot of time pairs programming with other programmers who were unfamiliar with traditional game engine architecture, and mentored a lot of them. Within this team, I was a positive influence, teaching many of them how the engine architecture worked, mentoring them on how concepts like Polymorphism, inheritance, and templates in C++ worked, and utilized tech meetings to coordinate communications.

            <h2>Modding Projects</h2>
            <p>Before DigiPen, I worked on a variety of modding projects for fun. These were primarily mods for Doom Eternal and Team Fortress 2, with the mods for Doom Eternal being focused on editing gameplay attributes, and the mods for Team Fortress 2 focusing primarily on custom levels. Through my experiments with modding projects, I learned how to edit data files, how to playtest consistently to achieve design goals, and how to iterate on design in an effective manner. Most importantly, these projects were what motivated me to become a software engineer. Modding communities promote this idea of the democratization of game development, and the development of open-source engine tools for developers of any background to use, for free.</p>
