                On this project, I was the Systems and Tools Programmer. I was the one who implemented a large part of the Entity Component System Framework. On top of that, I implemented a basic UI editor, implemented a lot of the targeting code using raycast algorithms, and optimized the game's physics and collision code to greatly speed up performance (1 fps -> consistently 200 on benchmark machines). On this project, I learned skills related to Data-Oriented Design in programming, and learned a lot about the structure of game engines. I also learned how to implement large chunks of gameplay code, and designing flexible toolsets for designers.

                On this project, I was the engine architect. I implemented core parts of the component based engine architecture. I also implemented Physics, Particle Effects, Deserialization, and a rudimentary Behavior system.

                My second DigiPen project, for this project I was the Producer, and also a programmer. I coordinated communications with the team and ensured we finished goals in order to meet deadlines. I implemented simple enemy targeting systems.

                My first DigiPen project, this was a simple top down tower defense. I focused on the design aspect of this project, balancing enemy and tower stats in order to ensure for a fair experience in the game.

                This was another project I did pre-DigiPen. It was a 2d platformer made in Unity. It was a game jam, and for this game jam, my primary focus was on level design and UI implementation. I implemented all of the UI elements, as well as designed levels for this game.

            <h2>Modding Projects</h2>
            <p>Before DigiPen, I worked on a variety of moding projects for fun. These were primarily mods for Doom Eternal and Team Fortress 2, with the mods for Doom Eternal being focused on editing gameplay attributes, and the mods for Team Fortress 2 focusing primarily on custom levels. Through my experiments with modding projects, I learned how to edit data files, how to playtest consistently to achieve design goals, and how to iterate on design in an effective manner.</p>
