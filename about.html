            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there, <br>
                I'm Sakura Shih. I'm a student currently at the DigiPen Institute of Technology. <br>
                <br>
                I am a Systems/Tools Programmer with experience in Unity, Custom Game Engines, and in C/C++, and C#. <br>
                <br>
                I am passionate about LGBTQIA+ representation within the game industry. I am currently the President of DigiPen's LGBTQIA+
                student advocacy group (PRISM), and I work with administrative staff and faculty to organize events like DigiPen's involvement 
                within the Seattle Pride March, Redmond Pride, and have coordinated involvement with queer organizations like Eastside 
                Pride, Gay Gaming Professionals, and etc..
                <br> <br>
                Outside of academics, I am passionate about music, photography, fitness, cooking, anime, and games. <br>
    
                <br> My favorite music artists at the moment are Friday Pilots Club, South of France, and Battle Tapes. I generally like indie rock and indie pop.
                <br>

            </p>
            <h2>My core values:</h2>
            <p>1. Challenging yourself with new experiences and new challenges is important. You should challenge yourself as much as possible.</p>
            <p>2. Diversity and inclusivity is important. Diversity means actively choosing to listen to underrepresented voices, and only making decisions after listening to all perspectives on a situation.</p>
            <p>3. Optimism and hope are the bedrock of a better tomorrow. It's better to have faith and build the better world you want to see, rather than wait for the world to be better.</p>
            <p>4. There isn't really such thing as normal. We shouldn't conform to the idea of "normal" and instead celebrate our differences and love one another for our differences.</p>
            <p>5. Believe in yourself.</p>
