            <h1>Why is Diversity in Games Important?</h1>

            <p> initially orated by Sakura Shih on 3//19/2024 at GDC </p>

            <p>I believe that each human is fundamentally an artist— everyone has something they so badly want to express. Thus, I believe the freedom to art, music, and games development are fundamental human rights, and unalienable rights, and that publishers and elitists that attempt to gatekeep what types of people are allowed in games development, who try to silence and restrict minority groups from expressing themselves in interactive media are violating the human rights of minority groups. People of any age, sexual orientation, gender, race, etc should be allowed to express themselves in all forms of media, and that includes games. Diversity in games is not your profit incentive— it’s a fundamental human right, and I believe, also a fundamental part of the human experience.</p>

            <p>From the dawn of history, humanity has always expressed itself using whatever media and art forms were available to them. From the earliest cave paintings and clay vases, self-expression has been a fundamental part of human expression. What right do publishers and corporations have to control the art that we use to express ourselves? This is why I believe having fundamental diversity incorporated into game industry structures is such an essential step for the future, from diverse publishers and diverse investors down to diverse artists, programmers, audio designers, and so much more. A world where diverse voices continue to be suppressed within games development is a world lacking soul— a world lacking the fundamental touches of human experience, a world lacking fundamental voices that broaden our perspectives in life.</p>

            <p>I also believe that a fundamental part of human existence is the ability to learn and comprehend other people’s perspectives. Why would we have been gifted with the capabilities to both learn and empathize, if not to learn from other people’s experiences, and to collaborate and work towards making the world a more equitable one?</p>

            <p>This is why we must continue fighting for more representation in gaming, in both the art form itself, and the developers that make the art. A world without diverse perspectives is one with no perspective at all.</p>
